# InterestCalculator #JavaFX #HGP #HCI #GUI

InterestCalculator is an application that performs interest calculations on money
invested. The capital amount to be invested, the interest rate and
the term of the investment in years, are entered into the text fields. 

When the calculate button is clicked, the details of the investment including the term 
of the investment, the capital amount invested, the interest rate and the final amount 
after accrued interest is added, are shown in the main text area. A button beside the
investment term text field produces a dialog. The dialog supports
selection of an investment term with the help of date pickers. Investment terms are
calculated in complete years only. Part years are not taken into account for the
purpose of accruing interest. The application supports simple and compound interest calculations. 
A user would then be able to compare the two.

This desktop graphical user interface application is designed using Java and JavaFX packages.
